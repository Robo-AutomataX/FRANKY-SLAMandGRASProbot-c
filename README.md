# FRANKY Project: Integration of ROS2, GRASP, and SLAM

This repository contains the FRANKY project, a robot that combines the capabilities of ROS2, GRASP, and SLAM for autonomous navigation, environment mapping, and object manipulation.

## Key Features

- **ROS2**: We utilize the ROS2 development framework to leverage its modular and scalable architecture. This allows us to create a flexible and robust system for control and communication among the different components of the robot.

- **GRASP**: Our FRANKY robot is equipped with an advanced robotic gripper that enables it to grasp and manipulate a wide variety of objects with precision and safety. The GRASP capability allows us to perform manipulation tasks in dynamic and collaborative environments.

- **SLAM**: FRANKY also incorporates SLAM capabilities for real-time environment mapping and simultaneous localization. By using sensors such as cameras, lidars, and depth sensors, the robot can map the environment and estimate its own position within that map.


## System Requirements

To use and contribute to this project, you will need:

- ROS2 installed on your system.
- The project-specific packages and dependencies mentioned in the documentation.
